# Oboete

Never forget your bookings and reminders! Oboete allows you to set a reminder once and it pings you multiple times based on an interval before the event is about to begin. This way you always know what's coming your way.

## Purpose

The application is designed to assists people with memory impairment so that they can easily keep a track of their day-to-day events. The "pre-snooze" alarms driven by an easy to navigate interface makes it an excellent tool to rely on if you have difficulty retaining information regards your events.
